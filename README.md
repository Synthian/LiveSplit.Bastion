# Bastion Auto Splitter
By **DevilSquirrel**, valentinoIAN, and Vulajin

## What it Does

The autosplitter is currently capable of starting and ending your splits, resetting your splits whenever you start a new game, as well as splitting whenever a load screen begins. This splitter is currently unable to split upon using objects, so the split times will not match the classic Skyway split method.

## Options (In Layout Settings)

**Start** - Toggles automatically starting splits.  
**End** - Toggles ending your splits upon input being disabled at the end of the game.  
**Reset** - Toggles automatically resetting.  
**Split Bastion** - Toggles splitting everytime you return to the Bastion.

**Split after The Sole Regret** - Toggles splitting upon loading the Wharf District Map   
**Split Tazal I** - Toggles splitting when you load the map with the Battering Ram pickup on it.  


## How to Install

## Special Thanks

I'd like to personally thank DevilSquirrel for the huge help with the auto splitter. Without his insane know how and hard work, this tool would not be available. Devil provided nearly all of the code, I merely just worked with him to fix it up. Vulajin was the one who found the variables in the code that we use to determine when to split, so he was also a huge help.
