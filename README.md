# Bastion Auto Splitter
By IanSynth, DevilSquirrel (Framework), and Vulajin

## What it Does

The auto splitter is currently capable of starting and ending your splits, resetting your splits whenever you start a new game, as well as splitting whenever you finish a level. The splitter can also split at a few special locations (like picking up the Battering Ram). There is now an IL mode for official individual level timings.

## Options (Edit Splits > Settings)

#### Split Modes
**IL Mode** - Your (single) split will start when you enter a level from the Bastion, and will end when exiting. Resets are all manual. Turning IL mode on disables all other settings.  
**Skyway** - Auto splitting will occur at loss-of-control at the end of each level (typically at the skyway).  
**Level Load** - Auto splitting will occur at the appearance of the load screen at the end of each level.  

#### Basic Settings

**Start** - Toggles automatically starting splits.  
**Reset** - Toggles automatically resetting.  
**Split** - Toggles splitting after completing each level.  
**End** - Toggles splitting at the end of the game.

#### Special Settings

**Split after Sole Regret** - Toggles splitting when you leave Rondy's Bar.  
**Split Tazal I** - Toggles splitting when you load the map with the Battering Ram pickup on it.  
**Split upon picking up the Battering Ram** - Toggles splitting upon picking up the Battering Ram.  


## How to Install

- Open LiveSplit and load your Bastion splits.
- Right click on LiveSplit > Edit Splits > Activate
- After you edit any settings, make sure you **save your splits.**
- Play and enjoy!

## Special Thanks

I'd like to personally thank DevilSquirrel for the huge help with the auto splitter. Without his insane know how and hard work, this tool would not be available. Devil provided nearly all of the code, I merely just worked with him to fix it up. Vulajin was the one who found the variables in the code that we use to determine when to split, so he was also a huge help.
